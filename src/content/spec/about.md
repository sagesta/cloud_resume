# Hello! I'm Samuel Adebodun

My journey into cloud engineering didn't start in a classroom. It began while I was serving at the [Nigerian Meteorological Agency](https://nimet.gov.ng/). Watching critical weather data transmit in real-time across complex networks sparked a profound fascination in me. I realised I didn't just want to maintain the hardware that kept the data moving; I tried to engineer the invisible systems that made it all possible.

That curiosity drove me to take up the DevOps Engineer course with [Conclase Academy](https://www.conclaseacademy.com/), where I learnt to peel back the layers of infrastructure. I started by building Virtual Private Clouds using raw Linux tools to understand precisely how packets flowed. Once I mastered the fundamentals, I went all-in on the Microsoft ecosystem, securing the Azure "Triple Crown" of Administrator (AZ-104), DevOps Engineer (AZ-400), and Solutions Architect (AZ-305).

But modern infrastructure isn't just about virtual machines. To truly understand the "microverse" where modern applications live, I expanded my scope to the Cloud Native world, earning my KCNA to master containerisation best practices.

Today, I specialise in turning "it works on my machine" into "it works everywhere." I blend high-level architectural strategy with hands-on DevOps execution to build clean code, secure pipelines, and resilient clouds.

When I'm not automating deployments or debugging clusters, you can usually find me gaming or experimenting in the kitchen. I am also an avid fan of sleeping; if napping were an Olympic sport, I would be a consistent gold medalist.
